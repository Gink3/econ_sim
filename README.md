# econ_sim
## Project Description
This is a multi-agent simulation of a cyclical economy looking to mimic the ways in which traders interact with a market economy.

## Simulation Goals
This simulation looks to see emergent behavior in the trader agents analogous to real world behavior without providing outside data. Specifically looking for reactions to various events such as a recession or new economic regulations being added.

## Agents
Current Agents
* Traders (Traders only stocks of companies)

Planned Agents
* Producers (Creates raw goods)
* Processors (Intermediate Product Manufacturers)
* Retailers (Creates profits, shared via stock dividends to owners, might need private owners)
* Consumers (Singular instance representing all product consumers)
* Government (Controlled by simulation to change economic polices)

## Observed behavior
Eventually the simulation will look to classify behavior of traders based on behaviors developed during simulations (i.e. Day traders, Short Sellers, Institutional investors).
